# PMC Officers Flow Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the PMC Officers Dashboard flow based on the API integration with proper status management.

## API Integration Completed

### 1. Enhanced Application Service (`src/services/application.service.ts`)
‚úÖ **Added Officer-Specific Methods:**
- `fetchOfficerApplications()` - Get applications visible to officers
- `getApplicationById()` - Get application details
- `updateApplicationStatus()` - Update application status
- `approveApplication()` - Approve applications
- `rejectApplication()` - Reject applications with reasons
- `forwardApplication()` - Forward to next stage/officer
- `scheduleAppointment()` - Schedule document verification appointments
- `signDocument()` - Digital signature functionality

### 2. Enhanced Dashboard Service (`src/services/dashboard.service.ts`)
‚úÖ **Updated Officer APIs:**
- `getJEApplications()` - Junior Engineer: Status 1,2 (Submitted, Assigned to JE)
- `getAEApplications()` - Assistant Engineer: Status 3,4 (Documents Verified, Under AE Review)
- `getEEApplications()` - City Engineer: Status 5,7 (Forwarded to EE Stage 1&2)
- `getCEApplications()` - Chief Engineer: Status 6,8 (Signed by EE Stage 1&2)
- `getClerkApplications()` - Clerk: Status 9,10 (Payment Completed, Ready for Certificate)

## API Endpoint Integration

### Using the Common API for All Officers
```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:5012/api/Application/list' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OFFICER_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "status": 1,
    "pageNumber": 1,
    "pageSize": 10
  }'
```

## Status Flow Mapping

### Application Status Workflow
```
Status 0: Draft
Status 1: Submitted ‚Üí [Junior Engineer]
Status 2: Assigned to JE ‚Üí [Junior Engineer] 
Status 3: Documents Verified ‚Üí [Assistant Engineer]
Status 4: Under AE Review ‚Üí [Assistant Engineer]
Status 5: Forwarded to EE Stage 1 ‚Üí [City Engineer]
Status 6: Signed by EE Stage 1 ‚Üí [Chief Engineer] 
Status 7: Forwarded to EE Stage 2 ‚Üí [City Engineer]
Status 8: Signed by EE Stage 2 ‚Üí [Chief Engineer]
Status 9: Payment Completed ‚Üí [Clerk]
Status 10: Ready for Certificate ‚Üí [Clerk]
Status 11: Certificate Issued ‚úÖ
Status 12: Rejected ‚ùå
```

## Officer Dashboard Implementations

### 1. Junior Engineer Dashboard
**Responsibilities:**
- Review submitted applications (Status 1)
- Schedule document verification appointments
- Verify documents physically 
- Forward to Assistant Engineer (Status 3)
- Reject if documents incomplete (Status 12)

**API Calls:**
```typescript
// Get applications for JE
const applications = await dashboardService.getJEApplications(1, 50);

// Schedule appointment
await applicationService.scheduleAppointment(appId, date, time, location);

// Verify documents and forward
await applicationService.updateApplicationStatus(appId, 3, 'Documents verified by JE');

// Reject application
await applicationService.rejectApplication(appId, ['Incomplete documents'], 'Rejected by JE');
```

### 2. Assistant Engineer Dashboard  
**Responsibilities:**
- Review applications from JE (Status 3)
- Technical review of qualifications
- Forward to City Engineer (Status 5)
- Reject if technical requirements not met

**API Calls:**
```typescript
// Get applications for AE
const applications = await dashboardService.getAEApplications(1, 50);

// Forward to City Engineer
await applicationService.forwardApplication(appId, 'City Engineer', 'Technical review completed');

// Reject application
await applicationService.rejectApplication(appId, ['Technical requirements not met'], 'Rejected by AE');
```

### 3. City Engineer Dashboard
**Responsibilities:**
- Sign applications in Stage 1 and Stage 2
- Digital signature with HSM integration
- Forward to Chief Engineer for final approval

**API Calls:**
```typescript
// Get applications for EE
const applications = await dashboardService.getEEApplications(1, 50);

// Sign document
await applicationService.signDocument(appId, 'RECOMMENDATION', 1);

// Forward to Chief Engineer
await applicationService.forwardApplication(appId, 'Chief Engineer', 'Signed by City Engineer');
```

### 4. Chief Engineer Dashboard
**Responsibilities:**
- Final approval authority
- Sign final certificates
- HSM signature integration
- Send for payment processing

**API Calls:**
```typescript
// Get applications for CE
const applications = await dashboardService.getCEApplications(1, 50);

// Final approval and sign
await applicationService.signDocument(appId, 'CERTIFICATE', 2);

// Send for payment
await applicationService.updateApplicationStatus(appId, 9, 'Approved for payment');
```

### 5. Clerk Dashboard
**Responsibilities:**
- Process payments
- Generate certificates
- Certificate dispatch
- Final completion

**API Calls:**
```typescript
// Get applications for Clerk
const applications = await dashboardService.getClerkApplications(1, 50);

// Process certificate
await dashboardService.processClerkApplication(appId, otp, {
  certificateNumber: 'PMC/2024/CERT/001',
  paymentAmount: '5000',
  paymentDate: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. OTP Verification
All officer actions require OTP verification for security:
```typescript
// Request OTP
await dashboardService.requestOfficerOTP(email, 'approve');

// Verify OTP and perform action
await dashboardService.verifyOfficerOTP(email, otp, 'approve', applicationId);
```

### 2. Digital Signatures
Integration ready for HSM-based digital signatures:
```typescript
await applicationService.signDocument(applicationId, documentType, stage);
```

### 3. Status Tracking
Real-time status updates with audit trail:
```typescript
await dashboardService.getApplicationHistory(applicationId);
```

### 4. Dashboard Statistics
Each officer dashboard shows relevant statistics:
```typescript
const stats = await dashboardService.getDashboardStats(officerRole);
```

## Testing the Integration

### 1. Setup Officer Authentication
```typescript
// Officer login
const response = await authService.officerLogin({
  email: 'officer@pmc.gov.in',
  password: 'password'
});

// Store token
localStorage.setItem('token', response.token);
```

### 2. Test Application Fetching
```typescript
// Test fetching applications for each officer role
const jeApps = await dashboardService.getJEApplications();
const aeApps = await dashboardService.getAEApplications();
const eeApps = await dashboardService.getEEApplications();
const ceApps = await dashboardService.getCEApplications();
const clerkApps = await dashboardService.getClerkApplications();
```

### 3. Test Status Updates
```typescript
// Test status progression
await applicationService.updateApplicationStatus(appId, 2, 'Assigned to JE');
await applicationService.updateApplicationStatus(appId, 3, 'Documents verified');
// ... continue through workflow
```

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Dashboard UIs** - Finish implementing the React components for each officer
2. **HSM Integration** - Connect with actual HSM service for digital signatures  
3. **Payment Gateway** - Integrate payment processing system
4. **Document Management** - Implement document upload/download functionality
5. **Notification System** - Add email/SMS notifications for status changes
6. **Audit Trail** - Complete audit logging for all officer actions
