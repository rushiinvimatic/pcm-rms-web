# PMC Officers Flow Integration - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

## Project Summary

I have successfully integrated the PMC Officers flow with proper API integration based on the provided API endpoint and workflow requirements. Here's what has been accomplished:

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Enhanced Application Service
**File:** `src/services/application.service.ts`

Added comprehensive officer-specific methods:
- `fetchOfficerApplications()` - Get applications for officers with proper filtering
- `getApplicationById()` - Fetch detailed application information
- `updateApplicationStatus()` - Update application status with comments
- `approveApplication()` - Approve applications
- `rejectApplication()` - Reject applications with reasons
- `forwardApplication()` - Forward applications to next officer/stage
- `scheduleAppointment()` - Schedule document verification appointments
- `signDocument()` - Digital signature functionality for officers

### 2. Enhanced Dashboard Service  
**File:** `src/services/dashboard.service.ts`

Updated all officer dashboard APIs to use the common `/Application/list` endpoint with proper status filtering:

- **Junior Engineer**: Status 1,2 (Submitted, Assigned to JE)
- **Assistant Engineer**: Status 3,4 (Documents Verified, Under AE Review)  
- **City Engineer**: Status 5,7 (Forwarded to EE Stage 1&2)
- **Chief Engineer**: Status 6,8 (Signed by EE Stage 1&2)
- **Clerk**: Status 9,10 (Payment Completed, Ready for Certificate)

### 3. Authentication System Verified
**File:** `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`

Confirmed proper officer role handling:
- Officer login integration with JWT token management
- Role-based authentication for all officer types
- Automatic token refresh and session management
- Support for Microsoft Claims format tokens

### 4. API Integration Test Page
**File:** `src/pages/officers/OfficersFlowTest.tsx`

Created comprehensive test interface to validate:
- Officer authentication
- All dashboard APIs
- Real-time API response validation
- Error handling and debugging

### 5. Complete Documentation
**File:** `OFFICERS_FLOW_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

Detailed implementation guide covering:
- API integration patterns
- Status workflow mapping
- Officer responsibilities
- Code examples for each role
- Testing procedures

## üîß API Integration Details
