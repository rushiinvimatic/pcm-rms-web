# Testing Utility Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a global testing utility function that integrates `applyDigitalSignature` from the application service with all existing "Update Stage (Test)" buttons across officer dashboards.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Global Testing Utility (`src/utils/testingUtils.ts`)
- **Function**: `handleGlobalUpdateStageForTesting`
- **Features**:
  - Handles user confirmation dialog
  - Updates application stage using `updateStageForTesting` API
  - **NEW**: Applies digital signature using `applyDigitalSignature` API with dummy OTP
  - Provides success/error feedback via toast notifications
  - Executes callback functions (usually to refresh data)
  - Includes comprehensive error handling

### 2. Updated Officer Dashboard Files
Updated the following files to use the global testing utility:

1. **JuniorEngineer/Dashboard.tsx**
   - Stage flow: Document Verification → Assistant Engineer
   - Includes digital signature application

2. **JuniorStructuralEngineer/Dashboard.tsx**
   - Stage flow: Document Verification → Executive Engineer  
   - Includes digital signature application

3. **AssistantEngineer/Dashboard.tsx**
   - Stage flow: Assistant Engineer → Executive Engineer
   - Includes digital signature application

4. **AssistantStructuralEngineer/Dashboard.tsx**
   - Stage flow: Assistant Engineer → Executive Engineer
   - Includes digital signature application

### 3. Key Features Added

#### Digital Signature Integration
- Calls `applicationService.applyDigitalSignature()` after stage update
- Uses dummy OTP `'123456'` for testing purposes
- Uses `applicationId` as `officerId` for testing
- Graceful error handling if digital signature fails

#### Stage Mappings
Added comprehensive stage mappings for all officer roles:
```typescript
STAGE_MAPPINGS = {
  JUNIOR_ENGINEER: Document Verification → Assistant Engineer
  JUNIOR_STRUCTURAL_ENGINEER: Document Verification → Executive Engineer
  ASSISTANT_ENGINEER: Assistant Engineer → Executive Engineer
  EXECUTIVE_ENGINEER: Executive Engineer → City Engineer
  CITY_ENGINEER: City Engineer → Payment
  CLERK: Clerk → Executive Engineer Signature
}
```

#### Enhanced User Experience
- Better confirmation dialogs with stage information
- Improved toast notifications indicating digital signature was applied
- Loading states show "Updating stage with digital signature (testing)..."

## Technical Implementation

### Function Signature
```typescript
export const handleGlobalUpdateStageForTesting = async (params: TestingUpdateParams)

interface TestingUpdateParams {
  applicationId: string;
  currentStage: ApplicationStageValue;
  nextStage: ApplicationStageValue;
  nextStageName: string;
  comments?: string;
  onSuccess?: () => Promise<void>;
  showToast?: (params: { title: string; description: string }) => void;
}
```

### Usage Pattern
```typescript
const handleUpdateStageForTesting = async (applicationId: string) => {
  const stageMapping = STAGE_MAPPINGS.OFFICER_ROLE;
  
  await executeWithLoading(async () => {
    await handleGlobalUpdateStageForTesting({
      applicationId,
      currentStage: stageMapping.currentStage,
      nextStage: stageMapping.nextStage,
      nextStageName: stageMapping.nextStageName,
      comments: 'Testing bypass - Stage updated (with digital signature)',
      onSuccess: async () => {
        await refreshData();
      },
      showToast: toast
    });
  }, 'Updating stage with digital signature (testing)...');
};
```

## Benefits

### 1. Centralized Management
- Single point of maintenance for testing logic
- Easy to modify digital signature behavior across all stages
- Consistent error handling and user feedback

### 2. Enhanced Testing Capabilities
- All test buttons now include digital signature application
- Better simulation of real workflow
- Comprehensive logging and error reporting

### 3. Future-Proof Architecture
- Easy to add new officer roles and stage mappings
- Extensible parameter system
- Clean separation of concerns

## Testing Parameters Used
- **OTP**: `'123456'` (dummy for testing)
- **Officer ID**: Uses `applicationId` as officer ID for testing
- **Digital Signature**: Applied after successful stage update
- **Error Handling**: Continues execution even if signature fails

## Files Modified
1. `src/utils/testingUtils.ts` (NEW)
2. `src/pages/officers/JuniorEngineer/Dashboard.tsx`
3. `src/pages/officers/JuniorStructuralEngineer/Dashboard.tsx`
4. `src/pages/officers/AssistantEngineer/Dashboard.tsx`
5. `src/pages/officers/AssistantStructuralEngineer/Dashboard.tsx`

## Next Steps for Production
When moving to production, consider:
1. Remove or disable the testing functions
2. Implement proper OTP generation and validation
3. Use actual officer IDs instead of application IDs
4. Add proper authentication checks
5. Remove dummy OTP values

The implementation provides a robust foundation for testing the complete application workflow including digital signature application.
