- `getOfficers()`: Fetch all officers
- `inviteOfficer(email, role)`: Send invitation to new officer
- `updateOfficerStatus(officerId, isActive)`: Activate/deactivate officers
- `updateOfficerRole(officerId, newRole)`: Change officer roles
- `deleteOfficer(officerId)`: Remove officers

#### System Administration
- `getAuditLogs()`: Fetch system audit logs
- `getSystemSettings()`: Get system configuration
- `updateSystemSettings()`: Update system settings
- `sendSystemNotification()`: Send notifications to officers

#### Analytics & Reports
- `getApplicationStats(period)`: Get application statistics by time period
- `getOfficerPerformance()`: Get officer performance metrics
- `exportApplications(format, filters)`: Export applications to CSV/Excel

### Officer Invitation API
Uses the provided API endpoint:
```
POST /api/Auth/invite-officer
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "string"
}
```

## Role Management

### Supported Roles

## UI Components

### Custom Components Created
- **Select Component** (`src/components/ui/select.tsx`): Custom dropdown for role selection
